Things to do: 

RHRS angle is defined in a separate file, 
and currently set up to move the spectrometer. 
Until the magnetic field options are changed 
within gemc, this has to be edited such that 
it rotates the rest of the hall around the 
spectrometer, keeping the RHRS at 0 deg while 
rotating everything else.
